## Duplicate-Image-Detection
A python script that locates duplicate images without factoring size.

### Rationale
Often times images on the internet are compressed, distorted, or resized. Which makes locating duplicate images difficult. However, by using image hashing we can compare two images together to detect duplicate images regardless of size.

tldr: I couldn't find a program that found duplicate images that were resized so I made this.
